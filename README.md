HappyPrime

Uncle Bob's Clean Code videos has a screencast of developing a software for calculating Lycher numbers with TDD
because someone said that you cannot develop such software with TDD.

That got me thinking about happy primes. 

> Riley Vashtee: [reading from display] Find the next number in the sequence: 313, 331, 367...? What?
> Martha Jones: You said the crew knew all the answers!
> Riley Vashtee: The crew's changed since we set of questions.
> Martha Jones: You're joking!
> The Doctor: 379
> Martha Jones: What?
> The Doctor: It's a sequence of happy primes - 379
> Martha Jones: Happy what?
> The Doctor: Just enter it!
> Riley Vashtee: Are you sure? We only get one chance.
> The Doctor: Any number that reduces to one when you take the sum of the square of its digits and continue iterating it until it yields 1 is a happy number, any number that doesn't, isn't. A happy prime is both happy and prime. Now *type it in*!
> **aside**
> The Doctor: I dunno, talk about dumbing down. Don't they teach recreational mathematics anymore?

Using that information one should be able to implement a function that returns next happy prime.
